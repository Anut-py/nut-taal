## Why Afrikaans? 
First of all, the vocabulary is not tightly coupled with Afrikaans dictionary. The language is written the way that is it easy to replace the hole dictionary with another

Choosing between "few words from all languages" and "all words from one language that mixes stems from different language families" I prefer the second, because this way the vocab much more predictable.
Also this way we have a vocab that sounds good, natural and distinguishable.

I personaly find Afrikaans the best option because:
- It is a Germainc language, located at Africa, that includes Romance and neighbour languages stems
- It is simplified language from Dutch, that is itself already relatively simple and regular
- It sound awesome
- A lot of stems are really short
